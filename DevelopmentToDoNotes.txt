Development ToDo Notes

Add popup (on click?) for perk descriptions
	Will test for on-click vs on-hover to see which feels the best

Change code to use Teen potentials for discounts instead of discounting a Teen for their own perks
	In the case where some future Teens share the same potential, this change will be good in the long run
